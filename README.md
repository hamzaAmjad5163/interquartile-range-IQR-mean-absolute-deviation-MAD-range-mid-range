Dataset: A CSV file with five columns: Date, Temperature (°C), Humidity (%), Wind Speed (km/h), and Precipitation (mm). The dataset contains 100 days of weather observations.

1. Data Preparation:
 Load the dataset into your preferred data analysis tool.
 Display the first ten rows of the dataset to ensure it is loaded correctly.

2. Data Analysis:
 For each variable (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation):
 Calculate the range, mid-range, and IQR.
 Compute the mean absolute deviation (MAD).
 Create box plots for each variable to visually inspect their distributions and identify any
outliers.
 Explore and visualize the relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., Temperature vs.
Humidity, Wind Speed vs. Precipitation) using scatter plots.
 Calculate and discuss the correlation coefficients between pairs of variables to
understand the strength and direction of their relationships.

3. Advanced Analysis:
 Identify days with extreme weather conditions (e.g., high temperature and low
humidity, high wind speed and high precipitation) and analyze their potential impact.
 Use descriptive statistics to summarize the weather conditions for the three months.

4. Report:
 Summarize your findings, including a discussion of variability and distribution for each
variable, observed patterns or outliers, and the relationships between variables.
 Include the box plots and scatter plots in your report to support your analysis.

5. Reflection:
 Reflect on the challenges and insights gained from analyzing multivariate data.
